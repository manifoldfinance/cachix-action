      Cachix
      With a simple configuration using Cachix, youâ€™ll never have to build any derivation twice and share them with all your developers.
      After each job, just built derivations are pushed to your binary cache.
      Before each job, derivations to be built are first substituted (if they exist) from your binary cache.
runs:
  using: node16
  main: dist/main/index.js
